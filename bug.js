The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email address or password contains certain special characters or is formatted incorrectly.  This often leads to silent failures, where the authentication process doesn't provide clear error messages, making debugging difficult. For example, an email with an unusual top-level domain might cause problems.  Another issue could be caused by an incorrectly implemented `onAuthStateChanged` listener, where the state changes aren't handled properly, leading to data inconsistencies or crashes.
