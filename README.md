This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue within the Firebase Authentication SDK.  When a user provides an email address or password with an unusual format, or containing characters not strictly allowed, the SDK might not throw a descriptive error, instead silently failing. This can lead to considerable debugging time and frustration. The `bug.js` file exemplifies such a scenario, and `bugSolution.js` presents a possible solution involving robust input validation and improved error handling.
